            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language
            used to make webpages interactive (e.g. having complex animations,
            clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced
            server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.Js which allow you
            to add more functionality to a website than simply downloading files
            (such as real time collaboration between multiple computers). Inside
            a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be
            connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic
            control over them.
          </p>

          <p>
            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
            Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
            operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
            be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
            additional objects; for example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
              For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
              elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
              clicks, form input, and page navigation. Server-side JavaScript
              extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running
              JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow
              an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity
              of information from one invocation to another of the application,
              or perform file manipulations on a server.
            </li>
            <li>
              This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the
              webpage (DOM) looks. And, likewise, Node.js JavaScript on the
              server can respond to custom requests from code written in the
              browser.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Getting started with JavaScript is easy: all you need is a modern
            Web browser. This guide includes some JavaScript features which are
            only currently available in the latest versions of Firefox, so using
            the most recent version of Firefox is recommended. You can start
            with Chrome or any modern browser, it's totally up to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two tools built into Firefox that are useful for
            experimenting with JavaScript: the Web Console and Scratchpad.

        <section class="main-section" id="javascript_and_java">
          <header class="article-header">JavaScript and Java</header>
          <p>
            JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
            different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
            does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
            JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
            and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
            renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.<br />

            In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
            declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
            number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
            values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the
            more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
            provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary
            for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without
            any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
            objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
          </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="variable">
          <header class="article-header">Variable</header>
          <p>
            You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
            The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain
            rules.
          </p>
          <p>
            A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
            dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
            Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
            "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
            (lowercase).

          <p>
            A conditional statement is a set of commands that executes if a
            specified condition is true. JavaScript supports two conditional
            statements:
          </p>
          <div class="code-div">
              <code>
                  if (val === true) {
                    console.log(true);
                  } else { console.log(false);
                  }
                </code>

                  case 'Oranges':
                    console.log('Oranges are $0.59 a pound.');
                    break;
                  case 'Apples':
                    console.log('Apples are $0.32 a pound.');

                    break;

        <section class="main-section" id="loops">
          <header class="article-header">Loops</header>
          <p>You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction then Y steps in another; for example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be expressed this way as a loop:</p>
          <div class="code-div">
            <code>
                let step;
                for (step = 0; step < 5; step++) {
                  // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.
                  console.log('Walking east one step');
                }
            </code>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="function">
          <header class="article-header">Function</header>
          <p>Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function is a JavaScript procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.</p>
          <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
          <div class="code-div">
            <code>
              function square(number) {
                return number * number;
              }
              square(2); // 4
            </code>
